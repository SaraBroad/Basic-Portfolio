        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="assets/images/SaraPic.jpg" alt="Sara's Photo" width=200>

        <p>With a thirst for knowledge and the drive for continuous personal and professional growth, I am
        ready to bring my diverse work and life experiences to your organization. Over the last decade, I
        have worked in a number of industries, which has provided me with the opportunity to learn a variety of professional skills that are applicable to the web development word. My ability 
        to problem solve, dedication to being a team player, and creativity are just a few of the skills that I can contribute
        as an employee.  </p>

        <p>My interest in web development arose during my current position as a technology teacher in the School
        District of Philadelphia. In my free time, I enjoy exploring Philadelphia with friends and family. I am 
        reader of fiction and The New Yorker Magazine. I have a passion for traveling and have been known to drive several
        hours to explore natural landscapes. I onced hiked the Inca trail in Peru for four days in the pouring rain.
